# DHF Culture Deck

Deployed link: https://digitalharborfoundation.github.io/dhf-deck/

## Usage

* Navigate to the deploy link
* Use arrow keys < > to navigate between slides
* Refresh page when needed - 'Digital Harbor Foundation' text is link to first page

## TODO List

* **HIGH PRIORITY:** Fix media queries for mobile. These look really bad.
* Add slide templates for images
* Add additional slide template for first slide (similar to what Guillermo Rauch's deck does -- linked below)
* Find way to semantically name the pages while still having arrows work
* Build tool for parsing single markdown.md file into unique pages?

## Technology

Built with Gatsby, React, GraphQL, and Markdown. Uses the excellent Gatsby starter "gatsby-starter-deck" by [Fabian Schultz](https://twitter.com/fschultz_)

His deck was inspired by Guillermo Rauchâ€™s deck on [Next.js](https://deck.now.sh/)
