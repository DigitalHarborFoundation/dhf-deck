# Learn to volunteer, volunteer to learn

If you don't know how to do something you should volunteer to learn. When an organization needs a thing that means it hasn't found a way to pay for it. This lack of funding can actually become an opportunity for you as it means the organization will gladly take a risk by accepting help from an unproven individual who volunteers with an interest in learning.
